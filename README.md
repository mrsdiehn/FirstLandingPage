# FirstLandingPage
First attempt at making a landing page using HTML and CSS with Flexbox


For this project I have only been given an image of a homepage and a picture with a list of the CSS fonts and colors used. 

At this point in my learning journey I have studied HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Git Hub and the terminal. Yes, the terminal is something I had to study.

Okay, wish me luck.
